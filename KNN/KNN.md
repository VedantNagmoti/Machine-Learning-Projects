## K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) 
is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a non-parametric and instance-based method that operates on the principle that similar data points exist near one another. Unlike other models that learn a function from training data, k-NN is a "lazy learner" because it memorizes the training dataset and performs computations only when making a prediction on a new data point.
