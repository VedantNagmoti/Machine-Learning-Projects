## DBSCAN
or Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise,
is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups together closely packed data points in a dataset and marks points in low-density regions as outliers or noise. 
It is particularly effective at identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes and does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance. 
The algorithm uses two main parameters: epsilon , a radius to define a neighborhood around a point, and MinPts, the minimum number of points required to form a dense region.
