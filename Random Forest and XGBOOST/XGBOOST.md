# XGBoost
It is an open-source machine learning library that implements a highly optimized and parallelized version of the gradient boosting algorithm, using decision trees as its base model. It is known for its speed, efficiency, and high performance on tasks such as classification and regression, and it includes features like regularization to prevent overfitting and built-in cross-validation. XGBoost is widely used in data science due to its scalability and ability to handle large datasets, and it supports various programming languages and distributed computing environments.
