# Decision Trees Regression
This repository contains an implementation of the Decision Tree Regression algorithm, a supervised machine learning technique used for predicting continuous numerical values. Unlike classification trees, this model predicts a real-valued outcome, such as house prices or temperature, by fitting a tree-like model to the data.

The algorithm works by recursively partitioning the dataset into smaller and smaller subsets based on input features, with each split designed to minimize the error in the resulting child nodes. The final prediction for a given data point is the average of the target values of the training data that lands in the same leaf node
