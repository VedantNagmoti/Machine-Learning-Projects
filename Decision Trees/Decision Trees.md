## Decision tree 
is a flowchart-like structure used for both classification and regression tasks, 
which visually maps out a series of decisions and their potential outcomes. 
It starts with a root node, which branches out through internal (or decision) nodes based on tests on attributes, 
eventually leading to a leaf node that represents the final outcome or prediction. 
Decision trees are popular because they are easy to interpret and can be used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into a series of simpler steps
