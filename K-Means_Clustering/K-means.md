## K-means clustering 
is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into a predefined number of distinct, non-overlapping subgroups, or clusters. Unlike supervised learning, it does not require labeled training data. Instead, it finds inherent groupings in the data based on similarity.
