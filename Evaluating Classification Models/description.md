We evaluate a classification model using a combination of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score, and a confusion matrix to summarize performance. A confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing a basis for calculating these metrics. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and Area Under the Curve (AUC) are also common for visualizing and evaluating performance, especially in binary classification.
